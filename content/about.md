I am a Portuguese Software Developer working in The Netherlands.
I started learning programming in the University, in 2009. There, I had the oportunity to learn Python, C and Java.
During studies, I also worked as Web Developer for Whitesmith, developing a Ruby on Rails website.
In 2014, received MsC in Computer Engils
neering from the University of Coimbra, Portugal.

In October, I moved to The Netherlands to work for Fidelity National Information Services as a Programmer Analyst for one year. There, I developed and maintained Java Web Services and Javascript frontend interfaces for the banking industry.

Then, I joined Bidmath, where I developed Ruby applications, used Docker and Kubernetes, and explored Big Data with Hadoop, Jupyter and Apache Beam.

My next challenge is Goboony, a platform that allows travellers to rent motorhomes from a local owner.
